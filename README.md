## Introduction
It’ s one thing two have color variables declared on top of your Sass/Less/Stylus stylesheet. It’ s another thing to use them in an intuitive and meaningfull way in your designs. That’s  where c-Tiles16 comes in to help out. There are two parts:

1.  A build script named `ctiles16`, that is a fork of [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder), and can be executed from the terminal/commandline, and generates preprocessor variables to be used by Sass, Less, or Stylus

2. A [colorscheming test playground](http://atelierbram.github.io/c-tiles16/colorscheming/index.html#7b8a8e) that is assembled to have the best colorscheming tools, alongside colorscheme-tiles **on one webpage**-test-playground, making it convenient to create your own colorscheme, with sixteen variables

## Getting started
A possible way to make this tool, or rather collection-of-tools, your own can be:

* download the [zip-file](https://github.com/atelierbram/c-tiles16/archive/master.zip), or clone the [the repo](https://github.com/atelierbram/c-tiles16) to your own computer
* when using Sass, open `assets/sass/ctiles16-custom.scss` (which is a copy of `ctiles16-ctiles.scss`) in a text-editor. Don’t rename it just yet, but:
* (this works best full screen) start editing the values of the variables with the text-editor on one side, and the browser-window with the test colorscheming playground (`colorscheming/index.html`) on the other side of your screen
* play with the hsl-picker to help you get along
* try some live editing with the hidden styles at the top
* from the dropdown-menu you can pick and see how other colorschemes look.
* there’s a button for toggling the page background-color, but you can also hover with your mouse over the colortiles
* refresh the colorschemer-webpage after each time you edit your `ctiles16-custom.scss`-colorscheme-variables file (or use something like LiveReload)
* When following the workflow above, you have been using [c-Tiles16](http://atelierbram.github.io/c-tiles16) to make a colorscheme made out of sixteen colors</li>

## Development

* Now put the colorscheme you just made as one of the first partial files to import in the `_base-partial` file (the one that is included throughout the whole project)
* Keep using the colorschermer any time you like to generate color-values during the design phase of the website
* One can make it a personal challenge to only use the colorscheme values, or variations of those with Sass color-functions
* BTW: You can als try to make a pull request on Github in order to submit your colorscheme to this collection here on c-Tiles16

## Usage of buildtool

Since c-Tiles16 is a fork of Base16-builder, you can [look it up on Github](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder) for more information.

Build color variations of Base16 with YAML scheme definitions and ERB templates.
Requires Ruby 1.9 or greater.

go in the terminal to `c-tiles16/schemes/`
```bash
cd  c-tiles16/schemes/
```

To build all schemes:
```bash
../ctiles16
```
Build only the ‘default’ theme
```bash
    > ../ctiles16 default.yml
```

Build a scheme stored on some webspace.
```bash
./ctiles16 https://awesome-schemes.com/my-scheme.yml
```
